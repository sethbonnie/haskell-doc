Haskell Doc
============

A locally run, haskell documentation server.


Installation
-------------
To run this, you need to have nodejs on your system. Yes, I know could have used Haskell to run this, but eh, best tool for the job...

Clone this repo, `cd` into the project, then run:

```sh
$ npm install
```

Usage
------

To start the server, run:

```sh
$ npm start
